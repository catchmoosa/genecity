Simulating an Artificial Society is an intriguing and challenging process, to help us to better understand the macroscopic ways in which humans function. Mathematical models usually make simplifications of the laws which govern societal ecosystems, by presuming that populations are homogeneous and that they cooperate in peace. In order to address the problems rising for heterogeneous populations, exploitation of agent technology can lead to systems where agents have a unique way of performing actions, as individuals.

The study of specific scenario-based closed models may help us deliver some useful conclusions through proper data analysis. Interpreting a society and its behavior is a difficult task though, and perhaps impossible to completely cover in full range all its aspects, which may be visible, or be hidden under a chaotic way of behaviour.

Keeping this in mind, we pursued the simulation of an artificial society, as a closed system, to study the epidemiological behavior due to hereditary diseases and how it affects a multi-agent population. As part of the siumulation, Agents acquire human characteristics: education about the disease, fear for the birth of non-healthy descendants, as well with other human-like mate selection criteria, as value, topological distance, age differences and others.

The simulating system, called GeneCity, deploys an initial population of agents, under user specified demographical and sociological data, and can observe the changes through a period of epochs, with mate selection, marriages, deaths, births, genetic crossover and mutation, both for the biological and social genes.

Technical: The software was implemented in `Java', using the `JADE' framework, which is suitable for multi-agent environments.
